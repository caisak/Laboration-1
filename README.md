## Assignment
This is the first JavaScript assignment in the JavaScript Basics course. The assignment is to create a text based interactive experience where the user can make changes in a world. These changes can be anything from going to another room or picking up items to talking
 to NPCs.
## Project
I was inspired by the children's book "Historien Om Någon" by Egon Möller-Nielsen and Åke Löfgren. The book follows the reader as they look through an apartment to find a cat (before they find the cat all they find is the MAYHEM the cat has left behind).

My story takes the player to their apartment where they are informed that their cat has hidden and that they need to locate it. 

The user can then click on different rooms and read a description of each room and choose to enter the rooms. Inside the rooms they can check if the cat is inside of a vase, a closet, a cat bed or a cardboard box.

When the user has found the cat the message "You found the cat, great job ${myName}! is displayed and the game is over.

## Delimitations:
* I am (currently) bad at JavasScript
* Due to two (!) family emergencies I have one braincell that I share with all orange cats around the world and my work is shit.
* I wish I could paint a really cute cat but my cat looks like shit and I couldn't make the background transparent in the software I used to draw (sketchbook)
* WHO exactly says to the player that their own cat is missing in their own apartment? A benevolent ghost? I don't know but it's weird.

## Specific requirements for a passing grade:
* Prompt is used to ask the user for commands
* Alert is used to give information to the user about the world
* Git and GitHub is used
* Project folder contains a README.md file
* The assignment is submitted on time
* Demo link to GitHub Pages
