## Assignment
This is the first JavaScript assignment in the JavaScript Basics course. The assignment is to create a text based interactive experience where the user can make changes in a world. These changes can be anything from going to another room or picking up items to talking to NPCs.

## Project
I was inspired by the children's book "Historien Om Någon" by Egon Möller-Nielsen and Åke Löfgren. The book follows the reader as they look through an apartment to find a cat (before they find the cat all they find is the MAYHEM the cat has left behind).

My story takes the player to their apartment where they are informed that their cat has hidden and that they need to locate it. 

The user can then click on different rooms and look for their cat in specific places. When they click a button to see if the cat hides in that place, an alert will show up to give the user information


and read a description of each room and choose to enter the rooms. Inside the rooms they can check if the cat is inside of a vase, a closet, a cat bed or a cardboard box.

When the user has found the cat a congratulatory message is displayed and the game is over.

## Delimitations:
* Clicking the buttons and accompanying alert should probably be written as a loop and not as separate files. But separate files work so that's how it's going to be for this project.
* Due to two family emergencies I have one braincell that I share with all orange cats around the world and my work is shit.


## Specific requirements for a passing grade:
* Prompt is used to ask the user for commands
* Alert is used to give information to the user about the world
* Git and GitHub is used
* Project folder contains a README.md file
* The assignment is submitted on time
* Demo link to GitHub Pages
